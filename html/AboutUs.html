    <p><h2>Darius Owens</h2>
      My name is Darius Owens. I'm currently on track to become a software developer. I come from a very diverse background. Before joining Code Fellows to become a software developer I was in the U.S. Navy where I worked as a weatherman. When my enlistment ended I worked in the security industry, insurance sales, car sales, and even delivered mail for the USPS. One of my biggest strengths I bring to the table is my ability to work with any person from any walk of life. <br />

      Hi, my name is Roger Reyes. I am currently making progress to becoming a software developer. Prior to this I worked in Satellite Communications which was a great field but I had come to the realization that it wasn't something I had passion for. Instead I decided to pursue something that was interesting to me and that was coding. When I had initially started out my biggest impression with this field was when I had finished coding my first project and I thought to myself, "I made this, I put this together". It was a feeling of progress and growth in something that I really enjoyed. Now, as I'm building my skills and portfolio I'm able to progress with passion in my work, extending my limits and hopefully encouraging those around me to grow as well. <br />

    <P><h2>Andrew Schiller</h2>
      I’ve worked for more than a decade in technical support roles, and now I’m developing software because I want to be more proactive and less reactive. Rather than just talking to users about what’s broken, I want to put my thinking cap on and build interfaces and tools that make users go “wow”. I switched to software development because I went back to the drawing board and decided that coding is a much better fit for who I am. My ideal development job would probably be for a company or product that I’m passionate about. But regardless of where or what I’m coding, my background in journalism and tech support means that I’m a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, which I think helps me excel as a full-stack developer. <br />
